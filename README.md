# nirs syncing script

Scripts for communication between 3 computers:
1. Stimulus presentation desktop (tcp client)
2. Laptop running oxysoft syncing with baby (tcp server)
3. Laptop running oxysoft syncing with adult (tcp client)

The scripts are recommended to be run on a command line matlab instance, with no java, desktop, editor etc matlab environments loaded, to minimise latency and RAM usage.
